                    <p class="card_p">
                        Taking place in a world where toys come to life when humans are not present, the plot of Toy
                        Story focuses on the relationship between an old-fashioned pullstring cowboy doll named Woody
                        and a modern space cadet action figure, Buzz Lightyear, as Woody develops jealousy towards Buzz
                        when he becomes their owner Andy's favorite toy. Following the success of Tin Toy, a short film
                        that was released in 1988, Pixar was approached by Disney to produce a computer-animated feature
                        film that was told from a small toy's perspective. Lasseter, Stanton, and Docter wrote early
                        story treatments, which were rejected by Disney, who wanted the film's tone to be "edgier".
                        After several disastrous story reels, production was halted and the script was rewritten to
                        better reflect the tone and theme Pixar desired: "toys deeply want children to play with them,
                        and ... this desire drives their hopes, fears, and actions". The studio, then consisting of a
                        relatively small number of employees, produced Toy Story under minor financial constraints.
