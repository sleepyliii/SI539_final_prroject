                    Despite the cruelty of her jealous stepfamily, Cinderella remained kind, spirited, and internally
                    beautiful. Her faith and everlasting optimism manifested itself into a Fairy Godmother, whose magic
                    served as a catalyst for Cinderella's ascent from servant to princess.

                    particularly disdainful of Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather, her benevolent rivals. She is frequently

                    harnessing the power of the king's trident and installing herself as ruler of all the ocean.
